User or organization site Project site
Create a repository
Head over to GitHub and create a new repository named username.github.io, where username is your username (or organization name) on GitHub.

If the first part of the repository doesn’t exactly match your username, it won’t work, so make sure to get it right.

What git client are you using?
A terminal GitHub Desktop I don't know
Clone the repository
Click the "Set up in Desktop" button. When the GitHub desktop app opens, save the project.

If the app doesn't open, launch it and clone the repository from the app.

Create an index file
Grab your favorite text editor and add an index.html file to your project:

index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>I'm hosted with GitHub Pages.</p>
</body>
</html>
Commit & publish
Enter the repository, commit your changes, and press the publish button.
